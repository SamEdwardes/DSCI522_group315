# UFC Fight Analysis

### Background

The Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) is the world's premier mixed martial arts (MMA) organization. Founded in 1993, the UFC is largely responsible for the growth of MMA and is now home to the world's best martial artists.

A UFC match involves two opposing athletes fighting over three rounds (five rounds for championship fights). There are three main ways an athlete can win a fight:

- **Submission** - Occurs when one opponent verbally submits or taps (e.g. rear naked choke).
- **Technical knockout (TKO)** - Occurs when the referee stops the fight because they have determined the fighter can no longer defend themselves (e.g. punch to the face).
- **Judges score card** - Occurs when the fight lasts for all scheduled rounds. A panel of three judges scores the fight using a 10 point system. The figher with more points is deemed the winner of the fight.

*Note there are several other possible ways to win including "technical decision", "disqualification", "forefeit". However these situations are uncommon.*
