##### How to submit contribution or feedback
If you notice a bug, or have a feature request, please send us a [GitHub Pull Request](https://github.com/sweber15/DSCI522_group315).

If you want to contribute or fix a bug, you can fork our repo and submit a pull request. 

The steps to clone our repo:

1. Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/{yourusername}/DSCI522_group315`

2. The steps to catch up with upstream changes:

`git remote add upstream https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI522_group315`

`git fetch upstream

git merge upstream/master`

Then you'll have all the updates in the master branch of your local fork. You can commit changes to your local master branch that are not on upstream and submit a pull request (PR) on GitHub asking to merge your branch into our project. For details on creating a PR, please see GitHub documentation [Creating a pull request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request). Please write details in the pull request including the motivation and purpose of your commit as well as a description of changes. We will review pull requests within 5 working days and you will get feedback in the PR discussion if anything needs to be changed.

All the contributors must obey our Code of Conduct.
